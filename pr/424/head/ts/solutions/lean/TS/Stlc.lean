--  # Stlc: The Simply Typed Lambda-Calculus

--  The simply typed lambda-calculus (STLC) is a tiny core calculus
--  embodying the key concept of *functional abstraction*. This concept
--  shows up in pretty much every real-world programming language in some
--  form (functions, procedures, methods, etc.).
--
--  We will follow exactly the same pattern as in the previous chapter when
--  formalizing this calculus (syntax, small-step semantics, typing rules)
--  and its main properties (progress and preservation). The new technical
--  challenges arise from the mechanisms of *variable binding* and
--  *substitution*. It will take some work to deal with these.
--
--  The STLC lives in the lower-left front corner of the famous *lambda
--  cube* (also called the *Barendregt Cube*), which visualizes three sets
--  of features that can be added to its simple core:

--  Calculus of Constructions
--   type operators +--------+
--                 /|       /|
--                / |      / |
--  polymorphism +--------+  |
--               |  |     |  |
--               |  +-----|--+
--               | /      | /
--               |/       |/
--               +--------+ dependent types
--             STLC

--  Moving from bottom to top in the cube corresponds to adding
--  *polymorphic types* like `∀ α : Type, α → α`. Adding *just*
--  polymorphism gives us the famous Girard-Reynolds calculus, System F.
--
--  Moving from front to back corresponds to adding *type operators* like
--  `List`.
--
--  Moving from left to right corresponds to adding *dependent types* like
--  `∀ n m : Nat, n = m`.
--
--  The top right corner on the back, which combines all three features, is
--  called the *Calculus of Constructions*. First studied by Coquand and
--  Huet, it forms the foundation of Lean's logic.

--  ## Overview

--  The STLC is built on some collection of *base types*: booleans,
--  numbers, strings, etc. The exact choice of base types doesn't matter
--  much — the definition of the language as well as its theoretical
--  properties work out the same no matter what we choose — so for the sake
--  of brevity let's take just `Bool` for the moment. In the next chapter
--  we'll see how to add more base types, and in later chapters we'll
--  enrich the pure STLC with other useful constructs like pairs, records,
--  subtyping, and mutable state.
--
--  Starting from boolean constants and conditionals, we add three things:
--  - variables
--  - function abstractions
--  - application
--
--  This gives us the following collection of abstract syntax constructors
--  (written out first in informal BNF notation — we'll formalize it below)
--  for STLC terms `t`.

--  t ::= x                     (variable)
--      | λ x : T . t           (abstraction)
--      | t t                   (application)
--      | true                  (constant true)
--      | false                 (constant false)
--      | if t then t else t    (conditional)

--  The Greek letter λ ("lambda") in a function abstraction `λx:T. t` is
--  what gives the calculus its name. The variable `x` is called the
--  *parameter* to the function; the term `t` is its *body*. The annotation
--  `:T` specifies the *type* of arguments that the function can be applied
--  to.
--
--  The types of the STLC include `Bool`, which classifies the boolean
--  constants `true` and `false` as well as more complex computations that
--  yield booleans, plus *arrow types* that classify functions (as is the
--  case in Lean).

--  T ::= Bool
--      | T → T

--  Some examples of STLC terms:

--   `λx:Bool. x`

--  The identity function for booleans.

--   `(λx:Bool. x) true`

--  The identity function for booleans, applied to the boolean `true`.

--   `λx:Bool. if x then false else true`

--  The boolean "not" function.

--   `λx:Bool. true`

--  The constant function that takes every (boolean) argument to `true`.

--   `λx:Bool. λy:Bool. x`

--  A two-argument function that takes two booleans and returns the first
--  one.
--
--  (As in Lean, a two-argument function in the lambda-calculus is really a
--  one-argument function whose body is also a one-argument function.)

--   `(λx:Bool. λy:Bool. x) false true`

--  A two-argument function that takes two booleans and returns the first
--  one, applied to the booleans `false` and `true`.
--
--  (As in Lean, application associates to the left — i.e., this expression
--  is parsed as `((λx:Bool. λy:Bool. x) false) true`.)

--   `λf:Bool → Bool. f (f true)`

--  A higher-order function that takes a *function* `f` (from booleans to
--  booleans) as an argument, applies `f` to `true`, and applies `f` again
--  to the result.

--   `(λf:Bool → Bool. f (f true)) (λx:Bool. false)`

--  The same higher-order function, applied to the constantly `false`
--  function.

--  The last two examples show, the STLC is a language of *higher-order*
--  functions: we can write down functions that take other functions as
--  arguments and/or return other functions as results.
--
--  The STLC doesn't provide any primitive syntax for defining *named*
--  functions: i.e., all functions are "anonymous." We'll see in chapter
--  `MoreStlc` that it is easy to add named functions — indeed, the
--  fundamental naming and binding mechanisms are exactly the same.
--
--  Now reconsider our examples, each along with its type:
--  - `λx:Bool. x` has type `Bool → Bool`
--  - `(λx:Bool. x) true` has type `Bool`
--  - `λx:Bool. if x then false else true` has type `Bool → Bool`
--  - `λx:Bool. true` has type `Bool → Bool`
--  - `λx:Bool. λy:Bool. x` has type `Bool → Bool → Bool` (i.e.,
--    `Bool → (Bool → Bool)`)
--  - `(λx:Bool. λy:Bool. x) false true` has type `Bool`
--
--  The last two, higher-order examples are left off the list on purpose —
--  working out their types is the subject of the quizzes that follow.

--   ----------------------------------------

--  ## Syntax

--  We next formalize the syntax of the STLC.

namespace Stlc

open scoped MyGetElem

--  ### Types

inductive Ty where
  | bool
  | arrow (τ₁ τ₂ : Ty)

--  ### Terms

inductive Tm where
  | var (x : String)
  | app (t₁ t₂ : Tm)
  | abs (x : String) (τ : Ty) (t : Tm)
  | tru
  | fls
  | ite (c t e : Tm)

--  The constructors above give us a precise representation of STLC syntax,
--  but expressions written directly with them quickly become hard to read.
--  We need some notation magic to set up the concrete syntax, as we did in
--  the Types chapter...
--
--  We will write STLC syntax inside `<{ ... }>` brackets. For example,
--  `<{ λ X : Bool . X }>` represents the term
--  `Tm.abs "X" Ty.bool (Tm.var "X")`.
--
--  This notation must also support definitions and proofs about
--  **arbitrary** piece of STLC syntax. For example, a theorem may
--  introduce Lean variables `t : Tm` and `τ : Ty`, representing an
--  arbitrary STLC term and type. Inside the brackets, we can then write
--  `<{ λ X : τ . t }>`. Here `X` is the name of a variable in the STLC
--  term being represented, while `τ` and `t` refer to the Lean variables
--  in the surrounding theorem.
--
--  The notation distinguishes these two uses by naming convention, which
--  we will follow throughout the STLC chapters:
--  - A name beginning with a capital Latin letter is taken literally as a
--    name in the STLC syntax. Thus `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are STLC term
--    variables. Such a name must be a single Lean identifier and cannot
--    contain a dot. In languages with named base types, which we will see
--    in the Sub chapter, names such as `A`, `Int`, and `Bool` name those
--    types.
--  - A name beginning with a lowercase letter or a Greek letter refers to
--    a Lean variable in the surrounding definition or proof. This lets us
--    use the usual names `x` and `y` for strings, `t` and `u` for terms,
--    `τ` for types, and `Γ` for contexts without additional punctuation.
--  - To insert a larger Lean expression, prefix it with `~`. For example,
--    `<{ ~(Tm.var "X") t }>` inserts the expression `Tm.var "X"` as the
--    function and the Lean variable `t` as its argument. The same escape
--    is needed to insert a capitalized Lean variable, since an unescaped
--    capitalized name is assumed to be an STLC name.
--
--  This capitalization convention applies to actual variable names in
--  concrete STLC examples and inside `<{ ... }>` brackets. In grammars,
--  inference rules, and general explanations, symbols such as `x`, `t`,
--  and `T` instead stand for an arbitrary variable name, term, or type. We
--  keep the conventional lowercase notation for these schematic symbols.

--  Here are the terms we will use as running examples, written in the new
--  notation:

abbrev idB := <{ λ X : Bool . X }>

abbrev idBB := <{ λ X : Bool → Bool . X }>

abbrev idBBBB := <{ λ X : (Bool → Bool) → (Bool → Bool) . X }>

abbrev k := <{ λ X : Bool . λ Y : Bool . X }>

abbrev notB := <{ λ X : Bool . if X then false else true }>

--  Note that an abstraction `λ x : T . t` (formally, `Tm.abs` applied to
--  `x`, `T`, and `t`) is always annotated with the type `T` of its
--  parameter, in contrast to Lean (and other functional languages like ML,
--  Haskell, etc.), which use type inference to fill in missing
--  annotations. We're not considering type inference at all here.

--  ## Operational Semantics

--  To define the small-step semantics of STLC terms, we begin, as always,
--  by defining the set of values. Next, we define the critical notions of
--  *free variables* and *substitution*, which are used in the reduction
--  rule for application expressions. And finally we give the small-step
--  relation itself.

--  ### Values

--  To define the values of the STLC, we have a few cases to consider.
--
--  First, for the boolean part of the language, the situation is clear:
--  `true` and `false` are the only values. An `if` expression is never a
--  value.
--
--  Second, an application is not a value: it represents a function being
--  invoked on some argument, which clearly still has work left to do.
--
--  Third, for abstractions, we have a choice:
--  - We can say that `λx:T. t` is a value only when `t` is a value — i.e.,
--    only if the function's body has been reduced (as much as it can be
--    without knowing what argument it is going to be applied to).
--  - Or we can say that `λx:T. t` is always a value, no matter whether `t`
--    is one or not — in other words, we can say that reduction stops at
--    abstractions.
--
--  Our usual way of evaluating expressions in Lean makes the first choice
--  — for example,

#reduce fun _x : Bool => 3 + 4

--  yields:
--
--      fun _x => 7
--
--  But Lean is rather unusual in this respect. Most functional programming
--  languages make the second choice — reduction of a function's body only
--  begins when the function is actually applied to an argument.
--
--  We also make the second choice here.

inductive Tm.IsValue : Tm → Prop where
  | abs (x : String) (τ₂ : Ty) (t₁ : Tm) : IsValue <{ λ x : τ₂ . t₁ }>
  | tru : IsValue <{ true }>
  | fls : IsValue <{ false }>

attribute [StlcEval] Tm.IsValue.abs Tm.IsValue.tru Tm.IsValue.fls

--  The example terms named above are all abstractions, hence all values.
--  We record that once each, so that the reduction examples can cite the
--  fact by name instead of unfolding the definition again at every use.

--  Note to developers (Yipeng Liu @berberman):
--      Did we explain the `..` syntax earlier?

theorem idB_value : Tm.IsValue idB := .abs ..
theorem idBB_value : Tm.IsValue idBB := .abs ..
theorem notB_value : Tm.IsValue notB := .abs ..

--  ### STLC Programs

--  Finally, we must consider what constitutes a *complete* program.
--
--  Intuitively, a "complete program" must not refer to any undefined
--  variables. We'll see shortly how to define the *free* variables in a
--  STLC term. A complete program, then, is one that is *closed* — that is,
--  that contains no free variables.
--
--  (Conversely, a term that may contain free variables is often called an
--  *open term*.)

--  Note to developers (Chris Henson @chenson2018, before next release):
--      Is the "shortly" above setting wrong expectations? Where exactly
--      are we defining the free variables in a STLC term? BCP 25: Indeed,
--      we need to define "free"!

--  Having made the choice not to reduce under abstractions, we don't need
--  to worry about whether variables are values, since we'll always be
--  reducing programs "from the outside in," and that means the `step`
--  relation will always be working with closed terms.

--  ### Substitution

--  Now we come to the heart of the STLC: the operation of *substituting*
--  one term for a variable in another term. This operation is used below
--  to define the operational semantics of function application, where we
--  will need to substitute the argument term for the function parameter in
--  the function's body. For example, we reduce
--
--      (λX:Bool. if X then true else X) false
--
--  to
--
--      if false then true else false
--
--  by substituting `false` for the parameter `X` in the body of the
--  function.
--
--  In general, we need to be able to substitute some given term `s` for
--  occurrences of some variable `x` in another term `t`. Informally, this
--  is written `[x:=s]t` and pronounced "substitute `s` for `x` in `t`."
--
--  Here are some examples:
--  - `[X:=true] (if X then true else false)` yields
--    `if true then true else false`
--  - `[X:=true] X` yields `true`
--  - `[X:=true] (if X then X else Y)` yields `if true then true else Y`
--  - `[X:=true] Y` yields `Y`
--  - `[X:=true] false` yields `false` (vacuous substitution)
--  - `[X:=true] (λY:Bool. if Y then X else false)` yields
--    `λY:Bool. if Y then true else false`
--  - `[X:=true] (λY:Bool. X)` yields `λY:Bool. true`
--  - `[X:=true] (λY:Bool. Y)` yields `λY:Bool. Y`
--  - `[X:=true] (λX:Bool. X)` yields `λX:Bool. X`
--
--  The last example is illuminating: substituting `X` with `true` in
--  `λX:Bool. X` does *not* yield `λX:Bool. true`! The reason for this is
--  that the `X` in the body of `λX:Bool. X` is *bound* by the abstraction:
--  it is a new, local name that just happens to be spelled the same as
--  some global name `X`.
--
--  Here is the definition, informally...
--
--      [x:=s]x               = s
--      [x:=s]y               = y                     if x ≠ y
--      [x:=s](λx:T. t)       = λx:T. t
--      [x:=s](λy:T. t)       = λy:T. [x:=s]t         if x ≠ y
--      [x:=s](t₁ t₂)         = ([x:=s]t₁) ([x:=s]t₂)
--      [x:=s]true            = true
--      [x:=s]false           = false
--      [x:=s](if t₁ then t₂ else t₃) =
--                      if [x:=s]t₁ then [x:=s]t₂ else [x:=s]t₃
--
--  ... and formally:

def subst (x : String) (s : Tm) (t : Tm) : Tm :=
  match t with
  | .var y =>
      if x = y then s else t
  | .abs y τ t₁ =>
      if x = y then t else <{ λ y : τ . [x := s] t₁ }>
  | .app t₁ t₂ =>
      <{ ([x := s] t₁) ([x := s] t₂) }>
  | .tru => .tru
  | .fls => .fls
  | .ite t₁ t₂ t₃ =>
      <{ if [x := s] t₁ then [x := s] t₂ else [x := s] t₃ }>

--
--  (3) `(λY:T₁. s (λX:T₂. X))`
--
--  (4) none of the above

--   ----------------------------------------

--  *Technical note*: Substitution becomes trickier to define if we
--  consider the case where `s`, the term being substituted for a variable
--  in some other term, may itself contain free variables. We say that `s`
--  is an *open* term.
--
--  Here is an example. Using the above definition to substitute the open
--  term
--
--      s = λX:Bool. R
--
--  (where `R` is a *free* reference to some global resource) for the free
--  variable `Z` in the term
--
--      t = λR:Bool. Z
--
--  where `R` is a bound variable, we would get
--
--      λR:Bool. λX:Bool. R
--
--  where the free reference to `R` in `s` has been "captured" by the
--  binder at the beginning of `t`.
--
--  Why would this be bad? Because it violates the principle that the names
--  of bound variables do not matter. For example, if we rename the bound
--  variable in `t`, e.g., let
--
--      t' = λW:Bool. Z
--
--  then `[Z:=s]t'` is
--
--      λW:Bool. λX:Bool. R
--
--  which does not behave the same as the substituting in the original `t`:
--
--      [Z:=s]t = λR:Bool. λX:Bool. R
--
--  That is, renaming a bound variable in `t` would change how `t` behaves
--  under our simple substitution. So substitution gets more complicated in
--  that setting, but fortunately we don't have that problem in our STLC
--  variant.
--
--  Fortunately, since we are only interested here in defining the `step`
--  relation on *closed* terms (i.e., terms like `λX:Bool. X` that include
--  binders for all of the variables they mention), we can sidestep this
--  extra complexity, but it must be dealt with when formalizing richer
--  languages.

--  ### Exercise (3 stars): substi_correct ⭐⭐⭐

--  The definition that we gave above defines substitution as a *function*.
--  Suppose, instead, we wanted to define substitution as an inductive
--  *relation* `Substi`. We've begun the definition by providing the
--  `inductive` header and one of the constructors; your job is to fill in
--  the rest of the constructors and prove that the relation you've defined
--  coincides with the function given above.

--  ### Reduction

--  The small-step reduction relation for STLC now follows the same pattern
--  as the ones we have seen before. Intuitively, to reduce a function
--  application, we first reduce its left-hand side (the function) until it
--  becomes an abstraction; then we reduce its right-hand side (the
--  argument) until it is also a value; and finally we substitute the
--  argument for the bound variable in the body of the abstraction. This
--  last rule, written informally as
--
--      (λx:T. t₁₂) v₂ ⟶ [x:=v₂] t₁₂
--
--  is traditionally called *beta-reduction*.

--  v.IsValue
--                         -----------------------      (appAbs)
--                          (λx:T. t) v ⟶ [x:=v]t
--
--                                t₁ ⟶ t₁'
--                            ----------------          (app1)
--                             t₁ t₂ ⟶ t₁' t₂
--
--                                v.IsValue
--                                t₂ ⟶ t₂'
--                            ----------------          (app2)
--                             v₁ t₂ ⟶ v₁ t₂'

--  ... plus the usual rules for conditionals:

--  --------------------------------                (ifTrue)
--                     (if true then t₁ else t₂) ⟶ t₁
--
--                    ---------------------------------               (ifFalse)
--                     (if false then t₁ else t₂) ⟶ t₂
--
--                                t₁ ⟶ t₁'
--          ----------------------------------------------------      (ifStep)
--           (if t₁ then t₂ else t₃) ⟶ (if t₁' then t₂ else t₃)

--  This is *call by value* reduction: to reduce an application `(t₁ t₂)`,
--  we
--  - first reduce `t₁` to a value: a function `λx:T. t`
--  - then reduce the argument `t₂` to a value `v`
--  - then reduce the application itself by substituting `v` for the bound
--    variable `x` in the body `t`.

--  ## Typing

--  Next we consider the typing relation of the STLC, which is meant to
--  prevent reduction from getting stuck.
--
--  For instance, the following two STLC terms are both stuck:

--   `if λX:Bool. X then true else false`

--  Here we branch on a function as though it were a boolean.

--   `true false`

--  Here we apply a boolean as though it were a function.

--  ### Contexts

--  Although we are primarily interested in the binary relation `⊢ t ⦂ T`,
--  relating a closed term `t` to its type `T`, we need to generalize a bit
--  to make the definitions work.
--
--  Consider checking that `λx:T₁₁. t₁₂` has type `T₁₁ → T₁₂`. Intuitively,
--  we need to check that `t₁₂` has type `T₁₂`. However, we have removed
--  the binder `λx`, so `x` may occur free in `t₁₂` (that is, `t₁₂` may be
--  *open*). While checking that `t₁₂` has type `T₁₂`, we must remember
--  that `x` has type `T₁₁`, in order to deal with these free occurrences
--  of `x`. Similarly, `t₁₂` itself could contain abstractions, and
--  typechecking their bodies could require looking up the declared types
--  of yet more free variables.
--
--  To keep track of all this, we add a third element to the relation, a
--  *typing context* `Γ`, which records the types of the variables that may
--  occur free in a term — that is, Γ is a partial map from variables to
--  types.
--
--  The new *typing judgment* is written `Γ ⊢ t ⦂ T` and informally read as
--  "term `t` has type `T`, given the types of free variables in `t` as
--  specified by `Γ`".
--
--  We'll also write `x ↦ T ; Γ` for "update the partial map `Γ` so that it
--  maps `x` to `T`," following the notation from the `Typeclasses`
--  chapter.
--
--  With these refinements, we are ready to give informal and formal
--  specifications of the typing relation.

--  Note to developers (Chris Henson @chenson2018, before next release):
--      I find the FULL explanation above much better than the TERSE one
--      below, since the question below seems ill-posed without extra
--      context. Why would one want to type a term `X Y` if we've just said
--      that we will just look at closed terms as our programs?

abbrev Context := PartialMap String Ty

--  A context is a `PartialMap` from variable names to types — the partial
--  maps of the `Typeclasses` chapter, which are total maps whose values
--  are optional, so that `none` at a variable means "not bound here".

--                     Γ ⊢ if t₁ then t₂ else t₃ ⦂ τ₁

--  We can read the three-place relation `Γ ⊢ t ⦂ T` as: "under the
--  assumptions in Γ, the term `t` has the type `T`."
--
--  In the formal development, we write this judgment inside the same
--  `<{ .. }>` brackets we use for types and terms, as introduced by the
--  following notational conventions.
--
--  A context is written `∅` when empty and `x ↦ τ ; Γ` when extended with
--  a binding. The whole judgment then goes inside the same `<{ … }>`
--  brackets as terms, written with the turnstile and colon of the Types
--  chapter: `<{ Γ ⊢ t ⦂ τ }>`.

--  The derivation is small enough to write out directly: an abstraction

--
--  Much like reduction sequences, long derivations of typing rules can
--  grow quite tedious to prove. Luckily, we can have Lean automate proofs
--  of this sort, using another tactic: `apply_rules`. This tactic works
--  much like `normalize`, but is more efficient and will make progress
--  even if it cannot solve the goal outright. Like `normalize`,
--  `apply_rules` also takes a `using` argument which tells Lean which set
--  of constructors to draw from.

  apply_rules using StlcTyping

--  It's worth noting that `apply_rules` relies on an important property of
--  our typing rules - namely, that they are *syntax directed*. A syntax
--  directed judgment is one where the syntax of a term completely
--  determines which rule can be applied at any given time; only one rule
--  can be applied to each term. This is important because `apply_rules`
--  just applies the first rule in its set of constructors or lemmas that
--  it can - it doesn't backtrack if that rule isn't correct. So, making
--  sure that only one rule can apply to any given term is important to
--  ensure that `apply_rules` always discovers a valid derivation, if one
--  exists.
